s = 0; k = 1; M = 100
while k <= M: # while loop will not run the correct amount of times it will run one less becasue it is missing an =
	s += 1./k #made 1 a float number instead of a integer
	k=k+1 # added 1 to k every times it runs because k was not being increase before 
print (s) # added () around s so that it can print correctly 

#ALL the problems that i found 

#how the while loop worked
#it would 99 times instead of running 100 time 
#this is why i added a a equal sign 

#the loop does not increase 
#the k of k stays the same
# the loop will go on infinitely 
#this is why i added k=k+1

#the print statement is missinng something 
#the print statement is missing ()
#i add () around 's'

#made 1 a float instead of an integer
